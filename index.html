        <h1>The lost civilization</h1>
        <p>
          I am fascinated by the origin and destruction of the legendary Atlantis civilization. According to Plato's works, this small island has been highly civilized around 9,000 years ago but sinked into the Atlantic ocean one day. Where did this high level of civilization come from? Did it come from another planet? For thousands of years, people have worked hard to find clues of this civilization. Is it possible that aliens themselves have destroyed the high-level civilization they built on Earth?I want to use this project to reproduce the imaginary scene when aliens tried to attack and destroy the civilization of Atlantis and the scene when the island sinked into the ocean.
