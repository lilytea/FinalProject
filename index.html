        <h1>The sinking civilization</h1>
        <p>
          The origin of human civilization has always been a topic that interests me. I am especially fascinated by the origin and destruction of the legendary Atlantis civilization. According to Plato's works, this small island has been highly civilized around 9,000 years ago. I am curious where did this high level of civilization come from? Is it transplanted from another planet? Plato's writings also said that this small island was finally destroyed by sinking into the bottom of the Atlantic ocean. For thousands of years, people have worked hard to find clues of this civilization. Is it possible that aliens themselves have destroyed the high-level civilization they built on Earth?I want to use this project to reproduce the scene when aliens tried to attack and destroy the civilization of Atlantis and the scene when the island sinked into the ocean.
